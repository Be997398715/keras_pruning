# keras_pruning
Using keras2.2.0 to pruning VGG16

This is a project using keras to prune CNN, now I finish it and wanna share.

Final result: acc：0.931 -> 0.870    model size：57.3 M -> 5.85M.  The weight file is logs/weights/ iter_3_prune_trained_model_weights.h5, and the model is logs/weights/iter_3_prune_trained_model_json.json.
Please read readme.txt first, thera are what i want to speak.
